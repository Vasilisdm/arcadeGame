## Instructions

* Select the avatar that best suits you and try to reach the water without letting the mean bugs touch you!
* Everytime you reach the water you are awarded with 100 points.
* If you get touched by a bug you loose 1 life and your score is reduced by 30 points. 
* If you loose all your lives(you get 3 in total), the game is over and your score is set back to zero!
